# Image Compression With The Use Of Neural Networks


### Implementation progress
1. The first try for the creation of the model was quite simple and based on the Cifar10 dataset. 
2. Both binary crossentropy and mean square error were used. The results are very blurry and the small size of the images of the Cifar10 dataset are suspected.
3. Locally downloaded STL10 dataset and results were of better quality compared to Cifar10. Conclusion, image resolution is _critical_.
4. Initialization of code following paper research with the Imagenette Dataset.

### Future steps
Future steps include:
- Training of the model
- Experimentation on the model
- Creation of metrics
- Comparison of model metrics with papers
