# Image Compression With The Use Of Neural Networks


### First implementation
The first try for the creation of the model was quite simple and based on the Cifar10 dataset. 

### Implementation progress
Both binary crossentropy and mean square error were used. The results are very blurry and the small size of the images of the dataset are suspected

### Future steps
Future steps include:
- The use of STL10 which is a 96x96 dataset originated from ImageNet
- The use of ImageNet itself
- Additional layers at the existing model
- Comparison with the common compression algorithms (jpeg, png etc)
- Comparison with similar technics
