# image-compression
This is a repo for my master degree's thesis. It is about image compression with the use of neural networks


### First implementation
The first try for the creation of the model was quite simple and based on the Cifar10 dataset

### Future steps
Future steps include:
- The use of STL10 which is a 96x96 dataset originated from ImageNet
- The use of ImageNet itself
- Additional layers at the existing model
- Comparison with ths common compression algorithms
- Comparison with similar technics
